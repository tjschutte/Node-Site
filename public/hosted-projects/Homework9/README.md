# Graphics TownJS 2017 Homework 9
* Skybox - all one smooth texture and it moves with the camera so you will never catch up to it. It acts like a render
distance (its not, but you can't really tell if there is stuff behinde it)
* Decal textures - Did some cools stuff with black and white images to mask othe two textures. I think they are cool at least...
Probably could have found some cooler images to use as textures, but this was more as a proof of concept
* Bump maps - Got the bricks to do something pretty cool with a brick normal map (see the images folders) I also had a random
normal map that I combined with a placeholder image. I couldnt think of anything really interesting to go with it, but this just shows a
different example of bump mapping.

                Like the projects area of this site, I am going to use this area
                to showcase my work. But here I will look at getting a little
                more in depth about each project, how I did it, why I did it,
                and what I learned from it. I also plan to experiment more with
                the design of this area to show off my projects and make the
                explination of them more interactive and intuitive.
            </p>

                For any questions about my projects, or if you have ideas or feed
                back on them I can be reached via email through my
                <a href="contact">contact</a> page, or via the corresponding github
                page directly.
